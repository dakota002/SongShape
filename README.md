# SongShape
Makes shapes using the 'super formula' from a song file.

The general idea is that this program can be fed a song file (.mp3, .wav, etc) and pump out 6 variables.
These are then fed into the superformula as defined here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superformula
The result is a list of [x y z] coordinates that can be plotted to make a shape.
